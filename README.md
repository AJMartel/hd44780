For ease of installation it is recommended to use an IDE that supports the library mananager which was implemented in IDE version 1.6.2

Unsupported IDE versions:
====================================
IDE versions prior to 1.0

IDE versions that should be avoided:
====================================
IDE versions 1.5 to 1.55 (unecessary file name restrictions, breaks many libraries)
IDE version 1.6.6 (has function prototyping issues that can break some sketches)
IDE version 1.6.8 (has serial port issues that breaks on certain boards)
