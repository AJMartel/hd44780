hd44780 examples
================
The hd44780 library package inclues many examples that demonstrate the capabilities of the library.

#### The examples are broken up into various sub directories.

* `hd44780examples`<br>
Contains sketches that should work with any LiquidCrystal API compatible library.
These examples also allow using a "wrapper sketch" to define the lcd object
and lcd geometry which then includes the hd44780 example sketch as an
alternative to having to edit the actual sketch.

* `ioClass`<br>
Contains subdirectories for each included hd44780 i/o class containing sketches
that are specific to the i/o class.
